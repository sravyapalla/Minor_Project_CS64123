# DDoS Attack Classification Using Deep Learning

## ðŸ“„Overview of DDoS Attacks
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic by overwhelming a target system, such as a server or network, with a flood of traffic. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, application services, or infrastructure, leading to service disruption and financial losses.


## ðŸ“ŠAbout the Dataset
The **DDoS Detection and Mitigation Dataset** is designed to help in the development of machine learning models for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. It contains both **benign network traffic** and **various types of DDoS attack traffic**, collected using **Mininet** and an **SDN Controller**.

### Features of the dataset:
- Simulated attack and normal traffic data
- Packet-level features extracted for analysis
- Suitable for training machine learning models to classify network traffic

## Data Collection Process
The dataset was collected using a **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** environment:
1. **Mininet** was used to create a virtual network topology.
2. **An SDN Controller** managed traffic flow.
3. **Custom attack scripts** simulated various DDoS attacks.
4. **Traffic monitoring tools** (like Wireshark) captured network flow data.
5. **Feature extraction** was done to prepare the dataset for machine learning.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Drop non-numeric and unnecessary columns.
3. Handle missing and infinite values by replacing them with NaN and dropping them.
4. Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
5. Shuffle the dataset for better generalization.
6. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## Getting started
To set up the environment and install dependencies, use the following:

### Requirements
